# Paperback - version 0.6
## Introduction
Paperback is a lightweight, fast, and accessible ebook/document reader designed to make reading fun and seamless, regardless of the file format being used or the user's preferences.

## System Requirements
Paperback currently runs on Windows 7 through Windows 11. It's possible it runs on earlier versions of Windows too and/or can be built in such a way that it will, but this hasn't been tested yet. Support for other platforms is planned for a future version.

## Features
* Incredibly fast and standalone.
* Simple tabbed interface, allowing you to open as many documents as you want side-by-side.
* Saves your cursor position across every document you open.
* Optionally remembers what documents you had open when you closed the program, and restores them on next launch.
* Designed with screen reader users in mind.
* Ability to navigate by various navigation units, including HTML headings, PDF pages, and epub sections.
* Robust find dialog, including features such as history and regular expression support.
* Can be ran entirely portably, or installed with file associations automatically set up.

## Currently supported filetypes
Paperback supports several common file formats, with more planned for future releases.

* CHM help files
* microsoft Word documents
* Epub books (version 2 and 3)
* FB2 ebooks
* HTML documents
* Markdown documents
* OpenDocument presentations
* OpenDocument text files

## Changelog
### Version 0.6
* Fixed whitespace handling at the beginning of pre tags in both HTML and XHTML documents.
* HTML inside Markdown code blocks will now be rendered properly. [#79](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/issues/79).
* If loading a book with a command line parameter while an existing Paperback instance is running, you'll no longer get an error if loading your document takes more than 5 seconds.
* Numpad delete now works to remove documents from the tab bar in addition to normal delete.
* Paperback can now optionally minimize to your system tray! This option is off by default, but turning it on will make the minimize option in the system menu put Paperback in your tray, able to be restored by clicking on the spawned icon. [#49](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/issues/49), [#85](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/pull/85).
* The installer now includes an option to view the readme in your browser after installation.
* The recent documents list has been dramatically expanded! Instead of simply showing you the last 10 documents you opened, it'll now show you a customizable number, with the rest of the documents you've ever opened being accessible through a small dialog. [#78](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/issues/78), [#80](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/pull/80), [#84](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/pull/84).

### Version 0.5

* HTML documents will now have the title as set in the title tag, if it exists. Otherwise, they'll continue to use the filename without the extension.
* Switched from UniversalSpeech to using a live region to report speech. This means no screen reader DLLs are shipped alongside the program anymore, and more screen readers will now be supported, such as Microsoft Narrator.

* The HTML parser will now recognize dd, dt, and dl as list elements.
* The table of contents in Epub books will once again be preserved exactly.

### Version 0.41

[#13](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/issues/13).
* Added an installer alongside the portable zip file! The installer will install Paperback into your Program Files directory, and automatically set up file associations for you. [#33](https://github.com/trypsynth/paperback/issues/33).
